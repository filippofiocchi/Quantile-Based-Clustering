# Quantile-Based-Clustering
In this repositori is available an implementation of the Quantile-based clustering algorithm introduced in [1].
For now only the simplest of the 4 algorithms is introduce, the one with common $\theta$ and unscaled variable.
The class containing the algorithm is in the file $\verb|QuClu.py|$ while in the jupyter notebook an example is avaible.
