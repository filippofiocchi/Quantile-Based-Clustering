# Quantile-Based-Clustering
In this repositori is available an implementation of the Quantile-based clustering algorithm introduced in 
[1].

For now only the simplest of the 4 algorithms is introduce, the one with common  &theta; and unscaled variable.
The class containing the algorithm is in the file QuClu.py while in the jupyter notebook an example is avaible.
In future I will upload the code for all 4 algorithm and make it a library.
